# CASE Apps

A revolutionary set of Autodesk Revit add-ins and tools, CASE Apps enhances your daily BIM workflows allowing your teams to do more — better and faster. Previously offered as pro and free subscriptions through [CASE] (http://case-inc.com/) and open sourced by [WeWork](http://wework.com), this software comes with a simple installer. 

While we hope some of our old and new friends continue to actively contribute to these apps on their own - we, as WeWork, will not be managing the GitHub community. We’ve included a description and instructions on how to access the open source code. After that, it’s up to you! 

Huge thanks to [Don Rudder](https://github.com/rudderdon) for developing most of these tools! And let’s not forget [Matthew Nelson](https://github.com/mnelson7982), [Matteo Cominetti](https://github.com/teocomi), and [Kyle Morin](https://github.com/kmorin) for contributing.

## Installation
Installation is no longer provided. This repo is to host the source code for research purposes.

## Structure
The code contains 2015 and 2016 verison of the add-in's projects organized in folders by year and set (as per below), these are respectively part of a 2015 and a 2016 solution.
Each project corresponds to a single add-in and will have an Entry namespace that contains the classes to initialize each add-in's command.
The Case.AppsRelease project defines the Revit ribbon layout and buttons, and the add-in manifest is pointing to the Case.AppsRelease.dll.
The installer is a Inno Setup script, it will take all the files into the deploy/ folder and copy them to the respective Revit Add-in folder.

### Building
Post-built events have been added to each .csproj file to copy the built dlls to the deploy/2015/ or deploy/2016/ folder. **Make sure these folders exist otherwise the projects might not build!** You might want to edit post-build debug events to copy the single project's dlls to the addin folder for testing.
